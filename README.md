# OOD & OOP Basics: Boris Bikes
This project was an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) set in week 1 of Makers Academy.

We had to create a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London that keeps track of a number of docking stations and bikes.
* Users must be allowed to rent bikes and return them
* The bikes can break, making them unavailable for rent
* A van can collect the bikes and move them to a garage where they are fixed before being returned to the docking station

To view the tests run rspec from the command line;

```sh
$ rspec
```
