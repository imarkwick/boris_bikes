# OOD & OOP Basics: Boris Bikes

This project was an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) set in week 1 of Makers Academy.

## Objective:

To create a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London that keeps track of a number of docking stations and bikes.

* Users must be allowed to rent bikes and return them
* The bikes can break, making them unavailable for rent
* A van can collect the bikes and move them to a garage where they are fixed before being returned to the docking station

## Technologies used:

* Ruby
* RSpec

## How to run tests:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/boris_bikes.git
$ cd boris_bikes
$ rspec
```
