# OOD & OOP Basics: Boris Bikes
This project was an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), where we were shown the very basics of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

I created a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London that kept track of a number of docking stations and bikes.
* Users must be allowed to rent bikes and return them
* The bikes can break, making them unavailable for rent
* A van can collect the bikes and move them to a garage where they are fixed before being returned to the docking station
