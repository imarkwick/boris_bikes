# OOD & OOP Basics: Boris Bikes
The goal of this project is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and show you the very basics of Object-Oriented Design (OOD).

We are creating a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. Our system will keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.

A system like this (in a much more complex form) is actually used by the real Boris bikes system in London. Every time you rent a bike or return it some objects get created somewhere in the system that tracks the usage of all bikes.
